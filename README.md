# Lab 14 - GUI VaccineRecord
_Learning Objective: Create a GUI - Graphical User Interface_

### Introduction ###
In an earlier lab we built the VaccineRecord class. In this lab exercise, we will reuse that class for this program with a graphical user interface(GUI) to collect input.

In the image below, we provide the necessary input data. We also use a checkbox in case the user has not yet received a second dose, if appropriate. 
As you know, some vaccines are single dose. This checkbox removes the second dose entries.

If you have not completed the VaccineRecord class, we provided a partial one which has only two methods that are necessary for this lab. 
The **init** and **str** method will be provided. You will need to add a third method, **print_vaccine()**

**NOTE:** Your code should make it so that if the checkbox is ticked, the entries are cleared(set back to empty) and hidden from the screen.
It should also recommend the user to follow up on their next dose.

### Your GUI input form should look like this:

### Your formatted COVID card should look like this

### Another example, if second dose has not been received

### Output
